# MEG

MEG is a solution that includes libraries that I think will be useful for .NET developers and that I have developed by putting my experience into use.

## 1)  MEG.FactoryBase

It is a library that enables the Factory Design Pattern to be implemented in a generic way and used practically with a clean coding structure.
You can read the details about the library [here](https://github.com/mwlt68/MEG/blob/logger/src/MEG.FactoryBase/README.md)
